# Apply Workflow End-to-End Verification plan

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Test Plan is to define the testing strategy, scope, roles, environments, schedule, preconditions, and deliverables for validating the Apply Workflow within Simpler Grants.
This ensures that Organization and Individual users can successfully start an application, complete required and conditionally required forms, upload documents, review, and submit a grant application without errors.

## 2. Preconditions

Before executing Apply workflow tests, the following must be satisfied:
• The user is able to login successfully with all required roles to create an application.
• The user can access Search funding opportunities page.
• The user can search for and select a specific Funding Opportunity.
• Required test data (organization or individual profiles, documents) is available.
• The system is available and stable.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1. In Scope

This Test Plan covers functional and non-functional aspects of the Apply Workflow:
• User login and role verification
• Funding Opportunity search and selection
• Start a new application for Organization and Individual users
• Save and update application data
• Required and conditionally required form validations
• Optional form selection for submission
• Document upload via forms and Attachments section
• Navigation between steps
• Review application
• Submission flow and confirmation page
• End-to-end workflows in a real environment

### 3.2. Out of Scope

• Post-submission editing
• Reviewer/Admin workflows
• Deep search or dashboard functionality
• Email notifications
• Upload file size validations, format validations and virus checks
• i18n translations, accessibility, or API validation
• Mobile browser checks

## 4. Test Objectives

• Validate that users can login and access Search Funding Opportunity page.
• Confirm users can complete the Apply workflow end-to-end for Organization and Individual users.
• Ensure all required and conditionally required validations work correctly.
• Verify optional form selection works as expected.
• Confirm documents upload correctly.
• Ensure UI components behave consistently across workflow states.
• Validate submission confirmation page loads with expected content.

## 5. Test Approach

Testing is divided into the following levels:

### 5.1. BDD (Gherkin) Feature Tests

• Feature files define user-visible workflows:
o Organization user: complete required/conditionally required forms, optional form selection, attachments, submission confirmation
o Individual user: same workflow without organization selection
• Does not cover i18n, accessibility, or API validation
• Location:
o frontend/tests/e2e/apply/features/happy_path_apply.feature
o frontend/tests/e2e/apply/negativecases_apply.feature
o frontend/tests/e2e/apply/edgecases_apply.feature

### 5.2. End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

• Validates full user experience: Start → Fill → Upload → Review → Submit
• Includes autosave, negative/edge case handling, network errors, browser compatibility checks
• Location:
o frontend/tests/e2e/apply/happypath.specs.ts
o frontend/tests/e2e/apply/negativecases.specs.ts
o frontend/tests/e2e/apply/edgecases.specs.ts

## 6. Test Environment

• Staging - QA verification in a production-like environment - Full Playwright end-to-end tests covering happy path, negative and edge cases, optional forms, attachment uploads, and submission confirmation
o URL:- https://staging.simpler.grants.gov/
• Production - Happy Path E2E Check to ensure submission works and confirmation page displays correctly
o URL:- https://simpler.grants.gov/

## 7. Entry & Exit Criteria

Entry Criteria:
• User workflows and preconditions defined
• Acceptance criteria approved
• Test environment stable
Exit Criteria:
• All test cases executed
• No blockers or high severity defects open
• E2E happy path workflow passes reliably

## 8. Risks

### API instability

The backend APIs that the Apply workflow depends on may be slow, unreliable, or return errors. This can cause tests to fail or the application to behave unpredictably during submission, form saving, or document uploads.

### Large file uploads

Users may attempt to upload files at or near the maximum allowed size. This can reveal performance issues, timeouts, or unexpected errors in the document upload process.

### Browser inconsistencies

The Apply workflow may behave differently across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Mobile browsers) due to rendering, JavaScript execution, or CSS differences. This can lead to UI misalignment, broken functionality, or inconsistent user experience.

### Multi-step form state loss

The workflow involves multiple steps and forms. There’s a risk that form data could be lost if the user navigates away or a network request fails. This can disrupt the user experience and lead to submission errors.
